# Road to Nowhere üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

A script to check files for broken http urls.

It finds the urls in each of the specified documents, and performs a get request for each of the urls.
It reports the exit code of the request to stdout, making it clear which and how many urls are broken.

## Installation

To install _roadtonowhere_, clone this repository, go into the directory, and install it using _pip_.

```console
git clone https://github.com/koenwestendorp/roadtonowhere
cd roadtonowhere
pip install .
```

## Usage

```
usage: roadtonowhere [-h] path [path ...]

check a document for broken urls

positional arguments:
  path        a file to be checked

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

### Example

To check the files in the _examples_ directory, run

```console
$ roadtonowhere examples/*
```

And the output will look something like this:

```
Parsing 'examples/example.html'... found 1 urls. Checking for broken urls...
        ok: [200] https://www.iana.org/domains/example
Found 0 broken urls in 'examples/example.html'.

Parsing 'examples/example.md'... found 5 urls. Checking for broken urls...
        ok: [200] https://hachyderm.io/@ma3ke
    BROKEN: [404] https://example.com/this_page_does_not_exist.html
        ok: [200] https://dwangschematiek.nl/
        ok: [200] https://twitter.com/
    BROKEN: [404] http://example.com/some_more_requests_to_non-existent_pages.html
Found 2 broken urls in 'examples/example.md'.
```

## Timeout

If a request takes more than 10 seconds, it will timeout.
The timeout is reported in the output as such:

```
        ...
        ok: [200] https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan
        ok: [200] https://github.com/gvb84/pbscan
   timeout: request took more than 10 seconds http://www.hping.org/
        ok: [200] https://github.com/traviscross/mtr
        ok: [200] https://github.com/mehrdadrad/mylg
        ...
```

## Filetypes

Currently, the script has good support for extracting urls from html files.
For finding urls in html files, `html.parser.HTMLParser` is used.

For Markdown and other filetypes, there is naive support:

- `.md` **Markdown** (heuristic: starts with `(http{,s}://`, ends with `)`)
- other filetypes (heuristic: starts with `http{,s}://`, ends with a whitespace character)

These heuristics are imperfect, but they do get the job done in most circumstances.
